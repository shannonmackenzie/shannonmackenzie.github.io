# Shannon MacKenzie, PhD Candidate

I am a planetary scientist working towards a PhD in Physics from the University of Idaho. My research interests include evaporites, lakes, dunes, and the processes that form them on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. 

When not in the lab, I enjoy cooking, knitting, gardening, and HIIT.
