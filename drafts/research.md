# Titan

The $Cassini-Huygens$ mission revealed that the largest moon of Saturn, Titan, is incredibly similar to our own planet. Much like Earth, nitrogen dominates the atmospheric composition, followed by methane and other trace species. Methane participates in the equivalent of Earth's hydrological cycle, raining down onto the surface, pooling in lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the atmosphere. A vast desert of organic sands wraps around Titan's equator where winds organize the sand into longitudinal dunes much like the Namib Sand Sea. Channels emerging from mountainous terrain suggest fluvial creation and movement of sediment, perhaps like the cobbles observed in the only image taken at the surface. 

## Evaporites
Under certain conditions, lakes can deposit relatively pure sediments when they evaporate (think the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah or Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia). Identifying these evaporites on the surface of Titan can tell us where liquids have been in the past. 

## The space between the dunes
The sand that makes up Titan's sand dunes is likely a mixture of organics. Though most spectral images of the surface have too coarse of spatial sampling to resolve dunes and interdunes, one sequences of images revealed an impressive heterogeneity in the areas between the dunes, the interdunes. Within tens of kilometers, the interdune areas exhibit distinctly different spectral signatures, indicating a difference in composition and/or grain size.
